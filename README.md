# AWS_retirement_Bot

6/4/2022
This bot is still a work in progres but it is functional and can handle inputs and give out erros based on the limited range of an indivuals age, name and income that they put into the advisor bot. the calculations of weight averages doesnt want to appear when running the program which is a strange since the closing of the code forces it to state what the results would be for SPY and AGG.
The project was updated and completed

The lambda bot code is th eone that works
